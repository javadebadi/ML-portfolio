I create a portfolio for data science and machine learning.

#### Project 01: Titanic (data visualization and exploratory analysis)
- Project 01: [Titanic (notebook)](./Project-01-Titanic/Titanic.ipynb)
- Project 01: [Titanic (directory)](./Project-01-Titanic/)   
In Project 01, I use the famous Titanic data to explore what are the features that lead to survival of a passenger in the Titanic collision. Interesting results and insights about data are written in Jupyter notebook. Here, I show one of the plots which illustrates survived and non-survived passengers according to different features such "ticket class of passengers" and etc:

#### Project 02: GAN (deep learning and generative adversarial networks)
- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (notebook)](./Project-02-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/Generative_Adversarial_Networks_GAN.ipynb)
- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (directory)](./Project-02-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/)   
Project 02 is an example of Generative Adversarial Notebooks which I have trained to generate fake bicycle hand-drawing. The image in below is some bicycles which are generated by this network:

#### Project 03: Glass (K-nearest neighbors (KNN) )
- Project 02: [KNN Glass (notebook)](./Project-03-Glass/KNN_glass.ipynb)
- Project 02: [KNN Glass (directory)](./Project-03-Glass/)   
Project 03 is about classification of a glass based on its oxide content. The data are taken from UCI machine learning repository. The classification boundary using KNN algorithm with (k=19) is shown here:
