I create a portfolio for data science and machine learning.

#### Project 01: Titanic (data visualization and exploratory analysis)
- Project 01: [Titanic (notebook)](./Project-01-Titanic/Titanic.ipynb)
- Project 01: [Titanic (directory)](./Project-01-Titanic/)   
In Project 01, I use the famous Titanic data to explore what are the features that lead to survival of a passenger in the Titanic collision. Interesting results and insights about data are written in Jupyter notebook. Here, I show one of the plots which illustrates survived and non-survived passengers according to different features such "ticket class of passengers" and etc:

#### Project 02: GAN (deep learning and generative adversarial networks)
- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (notebook)](./Project-02-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/Generative_Adversarial_Networks_GAN.ipynb)
- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (directory)](./Project-02-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/)   
Project 02 is an example of Generative Adversarial Notebooks which I have trained to generate fake bicycle hand-drawing. The image in below is some bicycles which are generated by this network:

#### Project 03: Glass (classification using K-nearest neighbors (KNN))
- Project 03: [KNN Glass (notebook)](./Project-03-Glass/KNN_glass.ipynb)
- Project 03: [KNN Glass (directory)](./Project-03-Glass/)   
Project 03 is about classification of a glass based on its oxide content. The data are taken from UCI machine learning repository. The classification boundary using KNN algorithm with (k=19) is shown here:

#### Project 04: Predict USA Houses Prices (regression problem solved using linear regression algorithm)
- Project 04: [A Python Implementation of Linear Regression algorithm (notebook)](./Project-04-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/Linear_Regression_from_scratch.ipynb)
- Project 04: [USA Houses Prices (notebook)](./Project-04-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/USA_Houses.ipynb)
- Project 04: [USA Houses Prices (directory)](./Project-04-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/)   
Project 04 is a regression problem. In this project, I do not use machine learning packages. I implement the linear regerssion algorithm from scratch as an exrecise to gain a sense of how these kind of algorithms are implemented in machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. Then, I use this code to solve a regression problem. The problem is to predict the price of houses in the USA using some features given in the data. The cost function vs number of training epochs is plotted here:
