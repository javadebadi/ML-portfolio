##### Description: This rope is a portfolio for data science and machine learning. I started to build this portfolio since August 15, 2019. My goal is to show what I know and what I can do as data scientist. A brief description of projects are presented in this page, for further explanation of each project, you can look at  the notebook by clicking on the links. I will be happy to have your feedback.

I create a portfolio for data science and machine learning.

#### Project 01: The Android App Market on Google Play
- Project 01: [Android App Market on Google Play (notebook)](./Project-01-The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play/notebook.ipynb)
- Project 01: [Titanic (directory)](./Project-01-The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play/)
   
In Project 01, I use data about the Android apps on Google play. After cleaning data, I conclude some interesting observations about the market. For example:
- Apps are categorized in groups such as family, game, tools, business, etc. The most freqeunt category is family and then the game.
- There is huge demand to install "Free" apps with respect to "Paid" apps. The mean number for free apps installation is about 1M, whereas the mean for paid apps installation is about 1000.
- There are features for sentiment analysis of customers. Although, the paid apps are less likely to be installed, but the users of paid apps are less likely to comment highly negative about the app.   
In the below plot, you see the boxplot in which the x-axis represents free or paid and the y-axis shows the number of installation of apps on devices.

#### Project 02: GAN (deep learning and generative adversarial networks)
- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (notebook)](./Project-02-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/Generative_Adversarial_Networks_GAN.ipynb)
- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (directory)](./Project-02-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/)   
Project 02 is an example of Generative Adversarial Notebooks which I have trained to generate fake bicycle hand-drawing. The image in below is some bicycles which are generated by this network:

#### Project 03: Glass (classification using K-nearest neighbors (KNN))
- Project 03: [KNN Glass (notebook)](./Project-03-Glass/KNN_glass.ipynb)
- Project 03: [KNN Glass (directory)](./Project-03-Glass/)   
Project 03 is about classification of a glass based on its oxide content. The data are taken from UCI machine learning repository. The classification boundary using KNN algorithm with (k=19) is shown here:

#### Project 04: Predict USA Houses Prices (regression problem solved using linear regression algorithm)
- Project 04: [A Python Implementation of Linear Regression algorithm (notebook)](./Project-04-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/Linear_Regression_from_scratch.ipynb)
- Project 04: [USA Houses Prices (notebook)](./Project-04-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/USA_Houses.ipynb)
- Project 04: [USA Houses Prices (directory)](./Project-04-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/)   
Project 04 is a regression problem. In this project, I do not use machine learning packages. I implement the linear regression algorithm from scratch as an exercise to gain a sense of how these kind of algorithms are implemented in machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. Then, I use this code to solve a regression problem. The problem is to predict the price of houses in the USA using some features given in the data. The cost function vs number of training epochs is plotted here:

#### Exercise Projects


#### Exercise Project 01: Titanic (data visualization and exploratory analysis)
- Exercise Project 01: [Titanic (notebook)](./Project-01-Titanic/Titanic.ipynb)
- Exercise Project 01: [Titanic (directory)](./Project-01-Titanic/)   
In Project 01, I use the famous Titanic data to explore what are the features that lead to survival of a passenger in the Titanic collision. Interesting results and insights about data are written in Jupyter notebook. Here, I show one of the plots which illustrates survived and non-survived passengers according to different features such "ticket class of passengers" and etc:
