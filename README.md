# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

I create a portfolio for data science and machine learning.

Links to Jupyter-notebook of projects:
- Project 01: [Titanic (notebook)](./Project-01-Titanic/Titanic.ipynb)
- Project 01: [Titanic (directory)](./Project-01-Titanic/)

- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (notebook)](./Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/Generative_Adversarial_Networks_GAN.ipynb)
- Project 02: [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (directory)](./Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN/)
Project 02 is an example of Generative Adversarial Notebooks which I have trained to generate fake bicycle hand-drawing. The image in below is some bicycles which are generated by this network:
